<!--High Tree Casino
High Tree Casino was built in 1867. It was the first casino in the great southwest where cowboys and indians used to gather and play a game of craps against each other.
Back then in the wild west though, to win was to live. They played by different rules in the southwest at High Tree Casino. Rolling a 7 or 11 meant you were goin to heaven.
Once you started the game there was no backing out until the opponent was 6 feet under. Those lucky enough the roll eqaul double numbers were granted a room and liquor
to spend the night in with the local women. High Tree Casino was built on blood and gold and is one of the most notorious casinos still around. Its said that they still 
host secret craps games were you can get it all or lose it all. Are you ready to play a game of life and death? Hit Play Craps and test your luck in the old southwest.-->
